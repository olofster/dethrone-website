	What/who?? 
	<ul><li>
								Art Hack Day is  24h part happening part hackathon. It's for hackers whose medium is art and artists whose medium is tech. (and organized by the same)
</li></ul>
<br><br>
							How ? 
<ul>
							<li>	Friday evening: Socializing, beverages, pre-building. <span style="font-size: 80%;">(We'll have a backlog of unbuilt art hacks to explore. Like all good ideas turns out this one has an even better <a href="../wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cory-arcangel-CPA.pdf">predecessor</a>)</span></li>
							<li>	Friday night: Build, build, build (+ we'll put up tents for sleeping over)
</li>
							<li>	Saturday wee hours / day: Re-build
</li>
							<li>	Saturday evening: <a href="../opening">Opening!</a> (to the public)
</li>
								(so we're on the lookout for drinks sponsors & we also love scrap materials)
</ul>
<br><br>
								Why ?!?
<ul>
						<li>		NYC startups are ripe for artistic exploitation. 
						</li><li>	If you can't get art done in 24h you can't get art done:-P
								</li><li>You love to flex your net art muscles
									</li><li>Ideas are free - see what happens when others work off your (art) backlog
									</li><li>Teams make better art than individuals
									</li><li>It's an anti-startup weekend. 
								</li><li>There are no prototypes just finished art works
								</li><li>Art hacks don't need demos
								</li><li>Art hacks are **** even when the underlying technology no longer is. 
</li></ul>
<br><br>
						&iquest;When/where? 
								<ul><li>Jan 2012 (location pending)</li></ul>
